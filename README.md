# Quiz-App Project
Quiz-App is a multi-page app built with NodeJS and Express that allows users to build, take and share quizzes.

This Project was made in collaberation with two group members for the Midterm project for Lighthouse Labs during the Web Development program. 

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies: `npm i`
2. Fix to binaries for sass: `npm rebuild node-sass`
3. Reset database: `npm run db:reset`
  - Check the db folder to see what gets created and seeded in the SDB
4. Run the server: `npm run local`

5. Visit `http://localhost:8080/`
